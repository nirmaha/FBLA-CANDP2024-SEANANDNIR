### The Prompt:
Create a program that allows your schoolâ€™s Career and Technical Education Department to
collect and store information about local businesses and community partners. This program
should include information on at least 25 different partners, with details such as, but not
limited to, type of organization, resources available, and direct contact information for an
individual. The program should enable users to search and filter the information as needed.

### Stack:
* Front-end: We used WPF(Windows Presentation Foundation) which uses XAML forms to create the UI.
  *  For the base template we used the WPF Modern Vertical Menu by [Jeyderht](https://github.com/Jeyderht/WPFModernVerticalMenu).
* Back End: We used C# and other dotnet Core libraries.
* Database: We used MongoDB Clusters.

### Requirements:
- Administrators can login to an account. Each administrator is attached to a school.
- Administrators can add partners and keep track of their roles.
